# Stormpath Angular + Express Fullstack Sample Project

This repository is an example fullstack web application, using Angular.js on the
front-end and Express.js as your back-end server.  It uses [express-stormpath][]
and [stormpath-sdk-angularjs][] to authenticate users, protect your server API,
and render default login and registration screens in your Angular application.
